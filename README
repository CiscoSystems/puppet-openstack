OpenStack module

This module complements the existig Keystone, Glance, etc. modules.

Its purpose is to provide some simpler classes that will simplify
deployment of OpenStack. It shifts the thinking from the individual
components of OpenStack to classes of nodes.

The simplest example is instead of deploying "a node that runs
nova-compute and nova-network", you deploy a "compute node". Whichever
components of Nova, Quantum and Glance that requires, will all be pulled
in.

It currently features two classes:

openstack::all-in-one:

    Installs all of OpenStack ("all" is only Keystone, Glance and Nova
    for now, but that'll change quite soon) on a single machine. If
    you're familiar with devstack, this is mostly the same thing, just
    driven by puppet.

openstack::compute-node:

    An extra compute node that can extend an existing
    openstack::all-on-one "cloud".
